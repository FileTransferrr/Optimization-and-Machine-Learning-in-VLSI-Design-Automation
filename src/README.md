# SAT Solver

This is a solver for SAT problems, implemented using the DPLL(Davis–Putnam–Logemann–Loveland) algorithm. The project supports reading input from CNF files, outputting results, and contains verification tools to verify the correctness of the solution.

## Function

- Solve SAT problems quickly through DPLL algorithm

## Usage

1. Place CNF files in the `CNF_Files` directory.
### Compile the program
    make all
If you use a different compiler, please edit the Makefile accordingly.
### Solve SAT problems
    make process
### Verify the solution
    make verify
### Clear generated files
    make clean
