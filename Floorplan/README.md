# Floorplan Solver

This is a solver for Floorplan problems, implemented using the Dijsktra algorithm. The format of inputs is shown in `./src/input.txt`.
The first line is an integer n which represents the amount of modules. The following two lines are positive sequence and negative sequence respectively.
The next n lines are the width and height of each module.
## Function

- Solve Floorplan problems quickly through Dijsktra algorithm

## Usage

Place input file in the `./src/input.txt` directory.
### Run the program
#### Compile the program
#### Generate a build folder and run CMakeLists
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
#### Clear output directory and executable file
    make clean_all
#### Delete the build folder(if necessary)
    cd ..
    rm -rf build
