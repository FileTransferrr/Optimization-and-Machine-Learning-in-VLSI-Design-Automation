# SAT Solver

This is a solver for SAT problems, implemented using the DPLL(Davis–Putnam–Logemann–Loveland) algorithm. The project supports reading input from CNF files, outputting results, and contains verification tools to verify the correctness of the solution.

## Function

- Solve SAT problems quickly through DPLL algorithm

## Usage

1. Place CNF files in the `CNF_Files` directory.
### Run the program with Makefile
#### Compile the program
    make all
If you use a different compiler, please edit the Makefile accordingly.
#### Solve SAT problems
    make process
#### Verify the solution
    make verify
#### Clear generated files
    make clean
### Run the program with CMakeLists
#### Generate a build folder and run CMakeLists
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
#### Verify the solution
    make verify
#### Clear output directory and executable file
    make clean
#### Delete the build folder(if necessary)
    cd ..
    rm -rf build
